Greedy algorithm to solve an 8-puzzle problem. The classical puzzle game consists of 8 numbered squares and one empty space. Squares can be moved up, down, left or right, but only if there is an empty space in that direction. The starting and target positions are predefined and it is necessary to find a sequence of steps that lead from one position to another. The program finds the solution according to either of two optimization criteria, namely, the number of wrongly positioned fields or the sum of the distances of individual fields from their target position. In each iteration the most promising node is selected and expanded to generate new candidate solutions. The cycle runs until there are no more options (the solution does not exist) or it manages to find the target position.
